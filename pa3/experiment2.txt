Experiment 2:
We ran a second experiment to test our vanilla bot against our modified bot. Both bots had equal tree sizes of 1000. 
Again, just as with experiment 1, our bots would end up in a draw regardless of the tree sizes. We suspect this is due to lacking randomness in the move selection algorithm and a possible problem with the way the bot is traversing the tree.
